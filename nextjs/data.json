The World Bank's Sovereign ESG Data Framework presents a 3-pillar framework consisting of metrics and corresponding data over time and regions. The Environment pillar measures the sustainability of a country's economic performance given its natural resource endowment, management, its risk or resilience to climate change and other natural hazards. It pays particular attention to the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic activity. It also accounts for sustainable energy access and food security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth."

The World Bank's Sovereign ESG Data Framework presents a 3-pillar framework consisting of metrics and corresponding data over time and regions. The Environment pillar measures the sustainability of a country's economic performance given its natural resource endowment, management, its risk or resilience to climate change and other natural hazards. It pays particular attention to the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic activity. It also accounts for sustainable energy access and food security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth."
