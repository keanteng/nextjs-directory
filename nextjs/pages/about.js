        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The NGFS,  launched at the Paris One Planet Summit on 12 December 2017, is a group of central banks and supervisors, which on a voluntary basis are willing to share best 
          practices and contribute to the development of environment and climate risk management in the financial sector, and to mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition 
          toward a sustainable economy. The NGFS brings together 108 central banks and supervisors and 17 observers. Together, they represent five continents and over 85% of global 
          greenhouse gas emissions, and are responsible for the supervision of all of the global systemically important banks and two thirds of global systemically important insurers. 
          The NGFS is chaired by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Secretariat, headed by Mr Jean Boissinot, is provided by Banque de France.
          </p>
        <p>The workstream on bridging the data gaps was set up in 2020 to turn the recommendation No. 3 of the NGFS First comprehensive report “Call for action”, (April 2019) into 
          practice. The co-chairs of this workstream are Mr Fabio Natalucci from the International Monetary Fund and Mr Patrick Amis from the Single Supervisory Mechanism/European 
          Central Bank. A Progress report on the work of the Workstream was published in May 2021.</p>
