The World Bank's Sovereign ESG Data Framework presents a 3-pillar framework consisting of metrics and corresponding data over time and regions. The Environment pillar measures the sustainability of a country's economic performance given its natural resource endowment, management, its risk or resilience to climate change and other natural hazards. It pays particular attention to the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic activity. It also accounts for sustainable energy access and food security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth."

The World Bank's Sovereign ESG Data Framework presents a 3-pillar framework consisting of metrics and corresponding data over time and regions. The Environment pillar measures the sustainability of a country's economic performance given its natural resource endowment, management, its risk or resilience to climate change and other natural hazards. It pays particular attention to the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic activity. It also accounts for sustainable energy access and food security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth."

  "remarks": "The STAR Vegetation Health Index is a product from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA-NESDIS) Global and Regional Vegetation Heath (VH) system estimating vegetation health, moisture condition, and thermal condition. VH products can be used as proxy data for monitoring vegetation health, drought, soil saturation, moisture and thermal conditions, fire risk, greenness of vegetation cover, vegetation fraction, leaf area index, start\/end of the growing season, crop and pasture productivity, teleconnection with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), desertification, mosquito-borne diseases, invasive species, ecological resources, land degradation, etc. The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) is a proxy characterizing vegetation health or a combined estimation of moisture and thermal conditions."

  "remarks": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator of the greenness of the biomes. It is a widely used indicator for ecosystems monitoring. Its formula is NDVI = (REF_nir - REF_red)\/(REF_nir + REF_red) where REF_nir and REF_red are the spectral reflectances measured in the near infrared and red wavebands respectively."
